# Project_M20
Final Project for Team Blue in UC Berkeley Data Analytics Class

Triangle role:

The queston we have stated is a classification problem. To answer it, I am going to run a supervised machine learning algorithm to determine the factors that signify potential gentrification of a neighborhood. I am planning to implement ensemble learners. Using cross-validation, I can find goodness of each model's fit. If none of the ensemble learners show a good result on testing data, I will switch to more interpretable algorithms.

I might also have to cluster neighborhoods to determine zones based on the real estate price, rent burden, and overall life quality, to draw more insights.
